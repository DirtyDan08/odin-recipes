        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Treat yourself to a cup of piping hot ginger tea. When made with fresh ginger root, it will be far tastier than ginger tea brewed from a stale tea bag. Many people find that the best time to drink ginger tea is in the morning because it's an invigorating way to start the day.</p>
        <p>Ginger tea is sometimes called ginger water. It is, quite simply, hot water infused with fresh ginger. It's a spicy drink that can be adjusted to taste by adding more ginger or letting it steep longer. This recipe brightens up the flavor with fresh lime juice and sweetens it with honey. It can be enjoyed either hot or cold, it's really easy to mix up a big batch to store in the fridge.</p>
