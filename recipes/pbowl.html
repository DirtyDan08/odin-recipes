        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>If you want a meal that's filling, flavorful, and fresh, then this ahi tuna poke bowl easily checks off all of those boxes. There's the classic rice base, topped off with tender, sushi-grade tuna and a plethora of vibrant vegetables. The result is a bowl that is filled to the brim with flavor and nutrition, and we have recipe developer Christina Musgrave to thank. "I love how easy this is," Musgrave says of her recipe. "It's so easy and tastes just like a restaurant [dish] — for a fraction of the cost."</p>
        <p>While it is easy to order this Hawaiian favorite, this homemade version definitely spares your wallet, and it's not much more of an effort than heading to a restaurant to pick up the food. Aside from the rice, there's no cooking involved — just a little prep and marinating time. But why are we still talking about it when we could be making it instead? Let's get right into it with this ahi tuna poke bowl recipe, which will undoubtedly become your lunchtime go-to.</p>
