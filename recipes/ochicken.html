            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Our easy orange chicken recipe puts a healthy spin on the sweet-savory Chinese takeout favorite.</p>
            <p>If it is not coated in a slightly sticky, tangy-sweet sauce, then it is just not orange chicken. Our easy orange chicken sauce hits all of the right notes—a little sweet, a little tart, a little savory, and a little spicy. Here is what you will need:</p>

            </ul>
            <h4>What You'll Need for The Chicken:</h4>

                <li>Boneless, Skinless Chicken Breast, cut into 2-inch cubes - 2 lbs</li>
                <li>Kosher Salt - 1 Tsp</li>
                <li>Vegetable Oil - 2 Tbsp</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>What You'll Need for Serving:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Steamed Rice</li>
                <li>Sesame Seeds, optional</li>
                <li>Chopped Green Onions, optional</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F. Fit a rack in the center position. Prepare a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper or spraying it with nonstick baking spray.</li>
                <li>In a large bowl, toss the chicken breast pieces with salt and the vegetable oil. Arrange the chicken pieces on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Bake the chicken in the oven on the center rack, until cooked through, about 20 minutes.</li>
                <li><strong>Prepare the orange sauce:</strong> In a small bowl form a slurry by combining the cornstarch with the water until smooth. In a small saucepan add the orange juice, orange zest, soy sauce, chili-garlic paste, sugar, garlic and rice wine vinegar, mix to combine.</li>
                <li>Bring the sauce to a simmer over medium-high heat. Add the cornstarch slurry to the sauce, stir to combine and reduce the heat to low. Simmer until the sauce has thickened, 3-5 minutes. Remove from the heat.</li>
                <li>Once the chicken is fully cooked, pour the orange sauce over the chicken and toss until the chicken is fully coated.</li>
                <li>Serve over white rice or cauliflower rice, sprinkled with sesame seeds and green onions if desired.</li>
            </ol>
